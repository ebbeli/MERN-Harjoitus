# MERN-Stack Test Project

Simple biking trip diary made with MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js

MongoDB-connection not working, because I erased the password mongoose.connect() for github.

## ToDo

1. Crypt and DeCrtypt passwords

2. Retirieve data for story editing. (Edit works, fields just empty)

3. Add image upload

4. Add commenting.

5. Login and content control with cookies

6. Styling

7. Local MongoDB for easier testing?
