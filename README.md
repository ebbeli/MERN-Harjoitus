# MERN-Stack Test Project

Simple biking trip diary made with MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js

Backend & Middleware works. To test stories, you need to use api-endpoints.

MongoDB-connection not working, because I erased the password mongoose.connect() for github.

Frontend still in progress. Registration works. Login is hardcoded. Stories need to be reconfigured for backend compatibility.
